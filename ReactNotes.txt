React Notes

JSX- looks a lot like HTML but renders like Javascript
Can't render 2 jsx elements next to each other (but you can put a wrapper around them)

Functional Components: 
Components you make are capitalized, html standard ones (like div) are not 

Styling should  only be added to traditional elements (like header or p), not your custom components

Need to use {} to use const within an element
ES6 uses `$` as well as {}
